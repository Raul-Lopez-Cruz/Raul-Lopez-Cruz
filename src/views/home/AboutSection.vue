          Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is RaÃºl LÃ³pez. I'm from MÃ©xico. I'm a graduate
          Computer Systems Engineer with a specialization in Emerging
          Technologies and I have
          <strong class="experience__description--highlight"
            >1+ year of experience</strong

          in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently enrolled in the
          <strong class="experience__description--highlight"
            >Oracle Next Education</strong

          One of my main achievements is that I've been able to publish a
          scientific research article in a recognized journal indexed by the

          scientific conferences and programming contests.
